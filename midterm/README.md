We have KNN, decision tree, random (Emilia written), SVM-ga (fish written), Bayes-ga classifier (sheep written), neural network (XDOwO written), PLA-pocket (Abner0214 written).
We use those techniques to predict whether a person has diabetes.

In KNN, type following to use:

```
make dep all clean
./experiment.sh
```

In decsinon tree also:
```
make dep all clean
./experiment.sh
```

In SVM:
```
make dep all clean
./main.elf
```

In bayes classification gene:
```
python bayes.py
```

In neural network:
```
```

In PLA-pocket:
```
```
