abstract = {Diabetes Mellitus is among critical diseases and lots of people are suffering from this disease. Age, obesity, lack of exercise, hereditary diabetes, living style, bad diet, high blood pressure, etc. can cause Diabetes Mellitus. People having diabetes have high risk of diseases like heart disease, kidney disease, stroke, eye problem, nerve damage, etc. Current practice in hospital is to collect required information for diabetes diagnosis through various tests and appropriate treatment is provided based on diagnosis. Big Data Analytics plays an significant role in healthcare industries. Healthcare industries have large volume databases. Using big data analytics one can study huge datasets and find hidden information, hidden patterns to discover knowledge from the data and predict outcomes accordingly. In existing method, the classification and prediction accuracy is not so high. In this paper, we have proposed a diabetes prediction model for better classification of diabetes which includes few external factors responsible for diabetes along with regular factors like Glucose, BMI, Age, Insulin, etc. Classification accuracy is boosted with new dataset compared to existing dataset. Further with imposed a pipeline model for diabetes prediction intended towards improving the accuracy of classification.}

abstract = {Diabetes is a common, chronic disease. Prediction of diabetes at an early stage can lead to improved treatment. Data mining techniques are widely used for prediction of disease at an early stage. In this research paper, diabetes is predicted using significant attributes, and the relationship of the differing attributes is also characterized. Various tools are used to determine significant attribute selection, and for clustering, prediction, and association rule mining for diabetes. Significant attributes selection was done via the principal component analysis method. Our findings indicate a strong association of diabetes with body mass index (BMI) and with glucose level, which was extracted via the Apriori method. Artificial neural network (ANN), random forest (RF) and K-means clustering techniques were implemented for the prediction of diabetes. The ANN technique provided a best accuracy of 75.7%, and may be useful to assist medical professionals with treatment decisions.}

ABSTRACT={Diabetes mellitus is a chronic disease characterized by hyperglycemia. It may cause many complications. According to the growing morbidity in recent years, in 2040, the world’s diabetic patients will reach 642 million, which means that one of the ten adults in the future is suffering from diabetes. There is no doubt that this alarming figure needs great attention. With the rapid development of machine learning, machine learning has been applied to many aspects of medical health. In this study, we used decision tree, random forest and neural network to predict diabetes mellitus. The dataset is the hospital physical examination data in Luzhou, China. It contains 14 attributes. In this study, five-fold cross validation was used to examine the models. In order to verity the universal applicability of the methods, we chose some methods that have the better performance to conduct independent test experiments. We randomly selected 68994 healthy people and diabetic patients’ data, respectively as training set. Due to the data unbalance, we randomly extracted 5 times data. And the result is the average of these five experiments. In this study, we used principal component analysis (PCA) and minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMR) to reduce the dimensionality. The results showed that prediction with random forest could reach the highest accuracy (ACC = 0.8084) when all the attributes were used.}

abstract="Diabetes is one among many chronic diseases. It is the most common disease and lots of peoples are affected by this. There are many things that are liable for diabetes, mainly age, obesity, weakness, sudden weight loss, and many more. Diabetes patients have high risk of diseases like cardiopathy, renal disorder, stroke, nerve damage, eye damage, etc. Detection of the disease isn't very easy and prediction is additionally costlier. In today's situation, hospitals are extremely busy due to COVID-19 pandemic, and it might be revolutionary if one could know if they're at risk of being diabetic without visiting a doctor. But the rise in Artificial Intelligence techniques can be used for disease prognosis. The objective of this study is to develop a model with significant accuracy to diagnose diabetes in patients. Moreover, this paper also presents an effective diabetes prediction model for better classification of diabetes and to enhance the accuracy in diabetes prediction using several machine learning algorithms. Different machine learning algorithms are utilized for early stage diabetes prediction, namely, Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, Support Vector Machine, Decision Trees, K-Nearest Neighbors, Gaussian Process Classifier, AdaBoost Classifier, and Gaussian Na{\"i}ve Bayes. The performances of these models are measured on respective criteria like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F-Measure, and Error. For this research work, latest available dataset dated 22nd July, 2020, is being utilized. Latest updated dataset will show comparatively better result.",

abstract={Diabetic retinopathy is a prominent cause of blindness among elderly people and has become a global medical problem over the last few decades. There are several scientific and medical approaches to screen and detect this disease, but most of the detection is done using retinal fungal imaging. The present study uses principal component analysis based deep neural network model using Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) algorithm to classify the extracted features of diabetic retinopathy dataset. The use of GWO enables to choose optimal parameters for training the DNN model. The steps involved in this paper include standardization of the diabetic retinopathy dataset using a standardscaler normalization method, followed by dimensionality reduction using PCA, then choosing of optimal hyper parameters by GWO and finally training of the dataset using a DNN model. The proposed model is evaluated based on the performance measures namely accuracy, recall, sensitivity and specificity. The model is further compared with the traditional machine learning algorithms---support vector machine (SVM), Naive Bayes Classifier, Decision Tree and XGBoost. The results show that the proposed model offers better performance compared to the aforementioned algorithms.},

abstract={One of the main reasons for disability and premature mortality in the world is diabetes disease, which can cause different sorts of damage to organs such as kidneys, eyes, and heart arteries. The deaths by diabetes are increasing each year, so the need to develop a system that can effectively diagnose diabetes patients becomes inevitable. In this work, an efficient medical decision system for diabetes prediction based on Deep Neural Network (DNN) is presented. Such algorithms are state-of-the-art in computer vision, language processing, and image analysis, and when applied in healthcare for prediction and diagnosis purposes, these algorithms can produce highly accurate results. Moreover, they can be combined with medical knowledge to improve decision-making effectiveness, adaptability, and transparency. A performance comparison between the DNN algorithm and some well-known machine learning techniques as well as the state-of-the-art methods is presented. The obtained results showed that our proposed method based on the DNN technique provides promising performances with an accuracy of 99.75{\&}{\#}x0025; and an F1-score of 99.66{\&}{\#}x0025;. This improvement can reduce time, efforts, and labor in healthcare services as well as increasing the final decision accuracy.},
