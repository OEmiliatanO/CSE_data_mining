title = {A Density-Based Algorithm for Discovering Clusters in Large Spatial Databases with Noise},
year = {1996},
publisher = {AAAI Press},
abstract = {Clustering algorithms are attractive for the task of class identification in spatial databases. However, the application to large spatial databases rises the following requirements for clustering algorithms: minimal requirements of domain knowledge to determine the input parameters, discovery of clusters with arbitrary shape and good efficiency on large databases. The well-known clustering algorithms offer no solution to the combination of these requirements. In this paper, we present the new clustering algorithm DBSCAN relying on a density-based notion of clusters which is designed to discover clusters of arbitrary shape. DBSCAN requires only one input parameter and supports the user in determining an appropriate value for it. We performed an experimental evaluation of the effectiveness and efficiency of DBSCAN using synthetic data and real data of the SEQUOIA 2000 benchmark. The results of our experiments demonstrate that (1) DBSCAN is significantly more effective in discovering clusters of arbitrary shape than the well-known algorithm CLAR-ANS, and that (2) DBSCAN outperforms CLARANS by a factor of more than 100 in terms of efficiency.},

abstract={Diabetic retinopathy is a prominent cause of blindness among elderly people and has become a global medical problem over the last few decades. There are several scientific and medical approaches to screen and detect this disease, but most of the detection is done using retinal fungal imaging. The present study uses principal component analysis based deep neural network model using Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) algorithm to classify the extracted features of diabetic retinopathy dataset. The use of GWO enables to choose optimal parameters for training the DNN model. The steps involved in this paper include standardization of the diabetic retinopathy dataset using a standardscaler normalization method, followed by dimensionality reduction using PCA, then choosing of optimal hyper parameters by GWO and finally training of the dataset using a DNN model. The proposed model is evaluated based on the performance measures namely accuracy, recall, sensitivity and specificity. The model is further compared with the traditional machine learning algorithms---support vector machine (SVM), Naive Bayes Classifier, Decision Tree and XGBoost. The results show that the proposed model offers better performance compared to the aforementioned algorithms.},

abstract={One of the main reasons for disability and premature mortality in the world is diabetes disease, which can cause different sorts of damage to organs such as kidneys, eyes, and heart arteries. The deaths by diabetes are increasing each year, so the need to develop a system that can effectively diagnose diabetes patients becomes inevitable. In this work, an efficient medical decision system for diabetes prediction based on Deep Neural Network (DNN) is presented. Such algorithms are state-of-the-art in computer vision, language processing, and image analysis, and when applied in healthcare for prediction and diagnosis purposes, these algorithms can produce highly accurate results. Moreover, they can be combined with medical knowledge to improve decision-making effectiveness, adaptability, and transparency. A performance comparison between the DNN algorithm and some well-known machine learning techniques as well as the state-of-the-art methods is presented. The obtained results showed that our proposed method based on the DNN technique provides promising performances with an accuracy of 99.75{\&}{\#}x0025; and an F1-score of 99.66{\&}{\#}x0025;. This improvement can reduce time, efforts, and labor in healthcare services as well as increasing the final decision accuracy.},

abstract = {Background
Clustering algorithms with steps involving randomness usually give different results on different executions for the same dataset. This non-deterministic nature of algorithms such as the K-Means clustering algorithm limits their applicability in areas such as cancer subtype prediction using gene expression data. It is hard to sensibly compare the results of such algorithms with those of other algorithms. The non-deterministic nature of K-Means is due to its random selection of data points as initial centroids.
Method
We propose an improved, density based version of K-Means, which involves a novel and systematic method for selecting initial centroids. The key idea of the algorithm is to select data points which belong to dense regions and which are adequately separated in feature space as the initial centroids.
Results
We compared the proposed algorithm to a set of eleven widely used single clustering algorithms and a prominent ensemble clustering algorithm which is being used for cancer data classification, based on the performances on a set of datasets comprising ten cancer gene expression datasets. The proposed algorithm has shown better overall performance than the others.
Conclusion
There is a pressing need in the Biomedical domain for simple, easy-to-use and more accurate Machine Learning tools for cancer subtype prediction. The proposed algorithm is simple, easy-to-use and gives stable results. Moreover, it provides comparatively better predictions of cancer subtypes from gene expression data.}
